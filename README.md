# neural-net-hacking-examples

## Roadmap

- [x] Add bias neuron
- [x] Calculate error
- [x] Backprop error
- [x] Train - Neurons update their connect weight values (learning!)
- [ ] Simplify training method, use basic stochastic gradient descent
- [ ] Add training method or Trainer class
- [ ] Standardize Data set shape for training
